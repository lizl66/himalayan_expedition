abstract: "This paper examines the factors influencing the success of Himalayan climbing expeditions between 1960 and 2020. Using data from over 10,000 expeditions, we analyze how variables such as team composition, route selection, seasonality, and equipment usage impact success rates. Statistical modeling reveals key predictors, including the size of the climbing team, oxygen usage, and the choice of climbing routes. These findings provide actionable insights for climbers and organizers to optimize planning and improve safety and success outcomes."
